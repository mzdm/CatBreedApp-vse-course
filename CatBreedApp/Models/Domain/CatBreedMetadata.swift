The Aegeanâ€™s coat is always tabby, with the usual M on the forehead. The Aegean is a natural breed, adapted over time to its harsh environment. It is a sturdy, healthy cat with a semi-long, soft, silky coat without undercoat. The Aegean is a very active cat that retains its hunting instinct. It is a very intelligent cat that can be taught to perform tricks. It is also a very social cat that gets along well with other cats and children.",
