## Setup - Env variables

This project uses `.xcconfig` files to manage environment variables so API keys etc. are not exposed. Please follow these steps to configure it:

1. **Create a new .xcconfig file**: In Xcode, navigate to `File > New > File`, then select `Configuration Settings File` under `iOS > Other` and name this file `Secrets.xcconfig`.

2. **Add your API key to the .xcconfig file**: Open `Secrets.xcconfig` and add your API key as follows:

   ```
   API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.
